Print-Head Durability Analysis

This project estimates the mean durability of print-heads (measured in millions of characters printed before failure) using confidence intervals. Destructive sampling constraints necessitate statistical methods for accurate quality assessment.

Analysis
99% Confidence Interval (Sample Standard Deviation):

Calculated using the t-distribution for small sample sizes with an unknown population standard deviation.

99% Confidence Interval (Known Population Standard Deviation):

Calculated assuming a population standard deviation of 0.2 million characters.

Outcome
The analysis provides statistically robust confidence intervals for mean durability, supporting data-driven quality control decisions.
